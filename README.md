## Commits and branches :deciduous_tree:

- For every feature issue we create a new branch.
- Every branch should have a name after what it's implementing.
- If it's a fix it should be prefixed with 'fix'.
Commits are done in the following way: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`    
  
Types list:
<ul>
    <li>feat (adding new features)</li>
    <li>fix (fixing bugs :bug:)</li>
    <li>docs (documentation related changes)</li>
    <li>refactor (code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds new features)</li>
    <li>perf (code change that improves performance)</li>
</ul>
